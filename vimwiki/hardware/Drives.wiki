Look up drives and mount points with:
sudo fdisk -l

check drive label numbers with:
    sudo efibootmgr
    set boot order with:
    sudo efibootmgr -o 0,1,2,etc


to find whether an installed disk is SSD or normal HDD, just check if the disk is rotational using the following command:

$ cat /sys/block/sda/queue/rotational

If the output is 1, the disk is HDD. If the output is 0 (zero), the disk is SDD. Because, SSDs won't rotate. So the output should be zero if you have SSD in your system.

sudo apt install hdparm
# hdparm allows you to work with ATA disks and the ATA diskâ€™s built in commands

sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass hunter2 /dev/sdX 
sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase-enhanced hunter2 /dev/sdX

== write zeros to drive sdX (good for secure erase)  ==
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
