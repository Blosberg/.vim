# from:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands


sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw limit 22

# make internetting possible
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443


# to allow X11 connections, which use ports 6000-6007, use these commands:

sudo ufw allow 6000:6007/tcp
sudo ufw allow 6000:6007/udp


# for rsync:

the rsync documentation says

    There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system: using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or contacting an rsync daemon directly via TCP. The remote-shell transport is used whenever the source or destination path contains a single colon (:) separator after a host specification. Contacting an rsync daemon directly happens when the source or destination path contains a double colon (::) separator after a host specification, OR when an rsync:// URL is specified.

Port 22 is the SSH port; it’s used when you tell rsync to connect via SSH, with a single colon (the “remote-shell” case above). Port 873 is the rsync dæmon port; it’s used when rsync is used with a double colon or a rsync:// URL.
