Step 1 - Generate and submit an SSH key
=======================================

To access the cluster, you have to generate an SSH key. The SSH key is your
cluster access and should be protected by a password. Follow the instructions
in the wiki:

https://bihealth.github.io/bih-cluster/connecting/generate-key/linux/
https://bihealth.github.io/bih-cluster/connecting/generate-key/windows/

Once you have created the SSH key, the next step depends on whether you are MDC or
Charite user:

https://bihealth.github.io/bih-cluster/connecting/submit-key/charite/

Step 2 - Login
==============

Please follow the instructions in our wiki to proceed to the login. Your
username is constructed from your MDC/Charite username with an appendix
distinguishing the two institutes as described here:

Depending on your operating system, please follow the instructions on how
to configure your SSH client:
