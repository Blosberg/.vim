= Operate until pattern=

    dtX – deletes everything up until the first X. The X can be any character at all.
    ctX – changes everything up until the first X. That is, deletes and leaves you in insert mode.
    ytX – yanks (copies) everything up until the first X.

With a pattern rather than a single character. Simply use /some_pattern and then <Enter> after either d, c, or y:

    d/foo<Enter> – delete up until foo is found
    c/bar<Enter> – change everything up until bar
    y/pattern<Enter> – yank everything up until pattern
