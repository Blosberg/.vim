This is my Vim/vimwiki repository of notes; I occasionally type things here that are relevant to my work once I've searched for the answer and would like to avoid searching again. Over time, it's become an indispensible part of my workflow, and perhaps it might be of use to others (perhaps not?).

Perusing this repo on github will not give you the same experience as incorporating it into your vim workflow (e.g. ascii art will not line-up properly, links will not always be clickable, etc.), if you use neither vim nor emacs, then this won't be of much use to you.

You're free to download this information and use it for any scholarly purpose, and if you begin to use it I'd appreciate a pull request with any appropriate additions you might make, and we can crowdsource more knowledge. This is offered with no warranty, liability or responsibility implied.
