Annotating exons, from [[https://genome.ucsc.edu/training/vids/transcript08.pdf|UCSC guide]]


To begin, navigate to the browser at genome.ucsc.edu. In the upper left hand corner, you can find two 
links that lead to the Browser database. 
[0:33] pick mouse mm10 database. 
Using the pull-down menu at the top of the graphic, we go to the Table Browser (or just type " tt ").  The 
Table Browser defaults to the genes and gene prediction group, the UCSC genes track, and the 
primary table of known gene for that track. 

The Table Browser gives us a choice of a number of different output formats. Select "BED (Browser Extensible Display)" output format. 
The “get output” button gives us a page where we can choose a number of 
different options.  
We will take the “Exons” option, give it a name and then and “get BED.” 
Right click -> save page as...
