 ==  The RIGHT WAY (secure, but unfortunately is way too cumbersome and doesn't work) ==
Somehow there's a way to do this properly with a credential manage.
( it involves some of these commands:
git config --global credential.credentialStore gpg
git config --global credential.credentialStore cache
pass init <gpg-id>
gpg --gen-key
)
But I only got it working once and it was such a convoluted process I can't remember how I did it.
Had to resort to the next alternative

somehow I've got a "credential helper" installed on Crick that uses my gpg key
$ git config --global credential.helper

I think I did this:
git config --global credential.helper cache

(To store it permanently, one can do this: 
$git config credential.helper store )
The next time you are prompted for your GitHub user name and token, the information will be stored permanently in a .git-credentials



== THE WRONG AND INSECURE WAY (which is far more straight-forward, and works, so I do it this way ... sigh ... )  ==


git remote set-url origin https://[USERNAME]:[TOKEN]@github.com/[Group]/[Repo]

# or for a new one:
git clone [^same as above]
