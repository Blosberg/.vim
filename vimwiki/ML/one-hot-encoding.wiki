To get each DNA sequence in the form of a matrix, we use one-hot encoding, which encodes every base in a sequence in the form of a 4-dimensional vector, with a separate dimension for each base. We place a "1" in the dimension corresponding to the base found in the DNA sequence, and "0"s in all other slots. We then concatenate these 4-dimensional vectors together along the bases in the sequence to form a matrix.
