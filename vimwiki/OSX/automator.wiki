How to Create a Resize Image Service in Automator

    Launch Automator from the Applications folder.
    Click New Document.
    Choose Service (or quick action) as the type of your document.
    Click the Service receives selected dropdown menu and select image files.
    Select Files and Folders in the Actions sidebar, and drag Get Specified Finder Items to the workflow area.
    Select Photos in the Actions sidebar, and drag Scale Images to the workflow area.
    Automator will prompt you to add a Copy Finder Items Action to save the original files in a separate folder. We're sticking to a simple workflow of resizing images here, so we click Don't Add.

    In the Scale Images action panel, type the width that you want to resize your images to. We're going to use 1200 pixels.

    In the Automator menu bar, select File -> Save..., call your new service "Resize Image", and click Save.

    Next time you want to resize an image, simply right-click (or Ctrl-click) the file in Finder and select Services -> Resize Image from the contextual dropdown menu. You can also drag a selection box over several images and resize them all in one go using the service.
