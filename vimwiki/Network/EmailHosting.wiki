A TXT (text) record is used to hold some text information. You can put virtually any free text you want within a TXT record. The most common uses for TXT records are Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys (DK), and Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM). 


log into https://www.dynu.com
Log into control panel, go to Dynamic DNS Service Icon DDNS Services   and click on your domain name. 

Go to DNS Records Icon DNS Records   to add TXT record that contains SPF data.

Node Name   Enter the subdomain name, for example, subdomain1. Leave empty for primary domain name.
Type   Choose "TXT-Text".
TTL   How long the server should cache the information.
Text   Enter the SPF data. For example, "v=spf1 a:mail.yourdomain.com ~all". 

... likewise for the other records (MX, s1domain, etc.)
