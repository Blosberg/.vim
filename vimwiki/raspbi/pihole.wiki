The steps involved in setting up pihole are:
https://pi-hole.net/


1. Install a supported operating system
2. Install Pi-hole
3. Use Pi-hole as your Domain Name service (DNS) server

# 3 is the big commitment, as it blocks your network from any other DNS.

Alternatives for local DNS are:

8.8.8.8  ( Google )
1.1.1.1  ( CloudFlair )

but the "Default" is to use the DNS provided by your ISP. To do that, use the IP address _of the router itself_

For Fritzbox, this is 192.168.178.1
In general, most routers use 192.168.1.1

To set this on your Fritzbox, go to the IP address for your router (i.e. above), and then

Home Network -> Network -> Network settings -> IPv4 settings -> Local DNS.

This will re-establish normal internet function.

1 Having your login information ready

    Have the domain name, your username, and the password with which you are registered with your dynamic DNS provider ready.
    Make note of the update URL of your dynamic DNS provider. For some providers the update URL includes the update request for both the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address. Other providers have separate update URLs for the IPv4 address and for the IPv6 address.

    Important:Further down in this guide you will find examples of update URLs from different providers. If there is no example for your provider, you can create the update URL yourself as described in the section "Creating your own update URL".

2 Setting up dynamic DNS

    Click "Internet" in the FRITZ!Box user interface.
    Click "Permit Access" in the "Internet" menu.
    Click on the "DynDNS" tab.
    Enable the option "Use DynDNS".
    Enter the update URL for your provider in the "Update URL" field. If the update request is to be performed for both IPv4 and IPv6 and your provider expects different update URLs for IPv4 and IPv6, then write both update URLs separated by a space in the field.

    Note:Further down in this guide you will find examples of update URLs from different providers. If your provider is not mentioned there, you can create the update URL yourself as described in the section "Creating your own update URL".
    Enter in the "Domain name" field the domain name you specified with your provider.
    Enter in the "Username" field the username of your user account with the provider.
    Enter in the "Password" field the password of your user account with the provider.
    Click "Apply" to save the settings.
    Now the FRITZ!Box transmits its current IP addresses to the provider every time it connects to the internet so that the FRITZ!Box can always be contacted via its unique dynamic DNS domain name.

    * configure your router to have [[Network/DHCP|DHCP]] clients use Pi-hole as their DNS server
