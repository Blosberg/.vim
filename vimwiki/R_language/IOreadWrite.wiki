# create a new folder, or directory, can be created in R using the dir.create function, like this:
dir.create("new_folder")
file.create("new_word_file.docx")
file.create("new_csv_file.csv")



# delete a file
unlink("some_file.csv")
 
# delete another file
file.remove("some_other_file.csv")
 
# delete a directory -- must add recursive = TRUE
unlink("some_directory", recursive = TRUE)

	
# list all files in current directory
list.files()
 
# list all files in another directory
list.files("C:/path/to/somewhere/else")


# If you want to get just the created time stamp of a file, call file.ctime:
file.ctime("C:/path/to/file/some_file.txt")

# Getting the last modified time stamp is similar to above, except we use file.mtime:
	
file.mtime("C:/path/to/file/some_file.txt")
