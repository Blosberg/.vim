Interpreting Ensemble ID codes:

An Ensembl stable ID consists of five parts: ENS(species)(object type)(identifier).(version).

    The first part, 'ENS', tells you that it's an Ensembl ID
    The second part is a three-letter species code. For human, there is no species code so IDs are in the form ENS(object type)(identifier).(version). A list of the other species codes can be found here.
    The third part is a one- or two-letter object type. For example E for exon, FM for protein family, G for gene, GT for gene tree, P for protein, R for regulatory feature and T for transcript.
    The identifier is the number to that object. Combinations of prefixes and identifiers are unique.
    Versions indicate how many times that model has changed during its time in Ensembl. [[http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/stable_ids/index.html|This document]] explains how we determine that a model has changed sufficiently to update version number. History pages for features show you when these changes took place.
