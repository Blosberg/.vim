	* In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
	* In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.
	* In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens.
	* Click Generate new token.
	* Give your token a descriptive name.


= Using tokens =

git remote set-url origin https://[USERNAME]:[TOKEN]@github.com/[Group]/[Repo]

# or for a new one:
git clone [^same as above]



somehow I've got a "credential helper" installed on Crick that uses my gpg key
$ git config --global credential.helper

I think I did this:
git config --global credential.helper cache

(To store it permanently, one can do this: 
$git config credential.helper store )
The next time you are prompted for your GitHub user name and token, the information will be stored permanently in a .git-credentials
