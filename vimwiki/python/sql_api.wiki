I initialized a local db with:

$ initdb -D  /Users/bosberg/Desktop/Science/Training/Ex_Files_postgress_w_python/localDB/
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "bosberg".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locales
  COLLATE:  C
  CTYPE:    UTF-8
  MESSAGES: C
  MONETARY: C
  NUMERIC:  C
  TIME:     C
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
initdb: could not find suitable text search configuration for locale "UTF-8"
The default text search configuration will be set to "simple".

Data page checksums are disabled.

initdb: warning: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    pg_ctl -D /Users/bosberg/Desktop/Science/Training/Ex_Files_postgress_w_python/localDB/ -l logfile start
