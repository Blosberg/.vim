= Dependencies =
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo reboot

sudo apt install apache2 mariadb-server libapache2-mod-php
sudo apt install php-gd php-json php-mysql php-curl php-mbstring php-intl php-imagick php-xml php-zip


= NextCloud installation =

Download NextCloud

You now need to download and extract the NextCloud archive:

# Go to the Apache web folder
    cd /var/www/html
# Get the NextCloud link here
# Remember to check the PHP requirements to make sure your current installation is compatible with the version you take
# In my case, I downloaded the 15.0.8 version

sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-15.0.8.zip

# Extract the file with unzip
sudo unzip nextcloud-15.0.8.zip

#    I’m showing you with the zip file as it’s easier to extract, but you can also get the .tar.bz2 archive from the NextCloud website
#    As we use root to extract files, we need to change the folder permissions to allow Apache to access it:
sudo chmod 750 nextcloud -R
sudo chown www-data:www-data nextcloud -R


= mysql =

MySQL configuration

After the MariaDB server installation, it creates a root user you can use only from the command line.
For NextCloud, I recommend creating a new user and a dedicated database:

# Connect to MySQL with root
sudo mysql

# Create the new user
CREATE USER 'nextcloud' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# Replace “password” by a strong password

# Create the new database
CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
# Give all permissions to the new user on this database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextcloud'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# Same thing here, just replace “password”with the previous password

# Save and exit
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit


CREATE USER 'nextcloud' IDENTIFIED BY
